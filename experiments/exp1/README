Experiment 1: Comparison ARMA and Kalman Filter.

Aim:
Compare Performance of a Linear Dynamical System with an ARMA, and ARIMA model

Experiment Requirements:
We should only use price as an observable variable when comparing ARMA and the Kalman Filter
Define a period of n days that are assumed to be covariance stationary.
Split into Training/Cross-Validation and Training/Test Sets respectively


Experiment Variables:
